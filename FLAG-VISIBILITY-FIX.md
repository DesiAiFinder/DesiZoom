# 🇮🇳 Indian Flag Visibility Fixed

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The dark overlay was covering the beautiful Indian flag, making it not properly visible. I've relocated the text to preserve the flag's visibility.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Flag Section (Hero)**
- **Only title**: "Welcome to Desi Finder" with strong drop shadows
- **Full flag visibility**: Orange, White (with Ashoka Chakra), Green sections all clearly visible
- **No overlay**: Removed the dark background that was covering the flag

### **2. New Content Section**
- **Separate white section** below the flag
- **All other text** moved here for perfect readability:
  - "Your one-stop shop for all Desi needs"
  - "Discover Indian businesses, community events..."
  - Location display (e.g., "Hyderabad, TS")
  - Action buttons (Find Businesses, Join Community)

### **3. Text Colors**
- **Flag section**: White text with strong drop shadows
- **Content section**: Dark gray text on white background for perfect readability

## 🎯 **Result**

Now you have:
- ✅ **Beautiful Indian flag** fully visible with all three colors
- ✅ **Ashoka Chakra** clearly visible in the white section
- ✅ **"Welcome to Desi Finder"** visible on the flag with drop shadows
- ✅ **All other text** perfectly readable in the white section below
- ✅ **Clean separation** between flag display and content

## 🌟 **Visual Impact**

The design now features:
- **Stunning flag display** that's completely unobstructed
- **Perfect text readability** in the dedicated content section
- **Professional layout** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Cultural pride** with the full Indian flag visible
- **User-friendly** with all text easily readable

The Indian flag is now the star of the show while maintaining excellent readability for all content! 🇮🇳
